  				<p>
            Sometimes the work you put in now will not benefit your business until much later. But it often pays off in ways that you didn’t expect. Two years ago I signed up for early access to an experimental app and it recently solved a conundrum faced by many growing businesses.
  				</p>
  				<p>
  					The primary reason businesses fail is because they run out of money. It’s easy to start a business with no money, but most of the time you need to raise outside capital to keep going. Bootstrapping doesn’t work for every business, mine included. We need to raise money in order to ship our product and achieve a network effect as quickly as possible.
  				</p>
  				<p>
            I began preparing to raise funds months ago. Under normal circumstances, fundraising is a challenging process. It’s more than a full-time job considering you have to piece together information for investors in a way that demonstrates you have a solid understanding of your intentions for starting a company and how you’ll achieve the goals you foresee with said company. It’s even more challenging if you have no previous exits and are an unknown entrepreneur. To top it all off, securing investment amid a global Coronavirus pandemic only makes it more difficult.
  				</p>
  				<p>
  					The entire world has suddenly shifted due to this unexpected catastrophe. Many people are not even considering taking on new investments. This will probably remain the case until they figure out how to model the pandemic’s impact on their current investments and apply it to future investment strategies. A few investors are still looking at pitch decks, but raising money from them has gotten more difficult. Unknown entrepreneurs, like myself, must go the extra mile to be noticed and raise money. We also have to avoid agreeing to the wrong terms out of desperation.
  				</p>

          <h4>What makes us investment worthy</h4>
          <p>
            <b>Discount Deck&trade; is worth an investment even during this devastating crisis.</b> We are able to monetize social media in a unique way that will bring value to consumers, influencers, brands, and investors. Our product connects a fragmented online world and grows revenues from what were once isolated pockets of influence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brands are still trying to figure out how to effectively convert social media influence into revenue. One mistake they’ve made has been to approach it as a media channel- “expecting this much reach should lead to this number of conversions.” That’s not the best way to approach influencer marketing.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have to identify the right influencers (AND be able to work with them), develop quality content (usually by giving up creative rights to the influencers), and pay to promote the posts on social platforms to gain maximum exposure. All of this can be time-consuming and costly, which is what makes it so difficult. Nevertheless, brands are expected to spend $9.7 billion on influencer marketing this year, with 80% going toward micro-influencer campaigns. There are approximately 34 million micro-influencers on Instagram alone, but brands are only able to leverage 1% or less. Discount Deck&trade; will unlock the earning potential of the remaining 99% for brands, at no upfront cost to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although our pitch deck was mostly complete before the pandemic, I was not satisfied with our solution to the chicken-or-the-egg problem that our business faces: Who comes first, the influencers or the brands?
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a demand-sided marketplace, and creating demand is the key to a cold-start. We had already identified the initial brands we wanted to target as advertisers on our app, but we also needed to identify influencers for our launch campaign. However, our method for channeling the demand was not ideal. I needed to strengthen our go-to-market strategy and back it up with a source of credible data.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>In March 2018, before the idea of Discount Deck&trade; was even in existence, I subscribed for early access to <a href="https://www.sparktoro.com">SparkToro</a>, an audience intelligence tool.</b> Because I had been following Rand Fishkin, one of the co-founders of Sparktoro and founder of <a href="https://www.moz.com">Moz.com</a>, for a while, I knew the service would be useful. I just wasn’t sure how exactly I would use it.

          <p>
            So many things happened in those two years: new experiences and adventures, ups-and-downs, and eventually the spark that ignited the current form of Discount Deck&trade;. I guess you could call this “hustle until you stumble upon it” kind of luck. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsoEbYSA9l4&t=55s">Naval Ravikant describes it as “creating numerous opportunities and generating momentum so that luck finds you”.</a> Doing work now makes it easier for life to offer unexpected opportunities. Because I constantly strive to improve my knowledge base by following industry leaders like Rand Fishkin or keeping track of new tools to enhance my projects, I was able to learn about SparkToro in its earliest stages. Now that I have access, I found a use for it as well. I created this luck for my company. It might have seemed a small or even inconsequential effort at the time, but as the saying goes, success is the sum of small efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back to my chicken-or-egg problem of which comes first: the influencers or the brands?
          </p>
          <h4>Strengthening our pitch deck with audience intelligence data</h4>
          <p>
            This is how I used SparkToro to strengthen my pitch deck with detailed data and analysis unavailable elsewhere. I believe this strategy and tool may be useful to many readers. (Just FYI, I paid for my subscription.)
          </p>
          <p>
            I began with a list of brands I wanted to target for partnerships. For each brand on my list, I conducted four different searches to identify which influencers are followed by my audience and the consumers who would buy the products of brands who I wanted to partner with:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>My audience “frequently talks about” [brand]</li>
            <li>My audience “frequently uses the hashtag” [brand hashtag(s)]</li>
            <li>My audience “frequently visits the website” [brand website]</li>
            <li>My audience “frequently talks about” [brand username on twitter]</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This type of search capability is exactly what I needed to measure the impact of influencers, and not just identify the influencers themselves. I also needed to demonstrate how these specific influencers tied back to the brands I want to target. I planned to use this data to convince brands of why the demand I am creating has a high probability of being directly beneficial to them. In short, the influencers in my launch campaign have followers who are already interested in their brand.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the brands I want to work with is Nike, so I will use them as an example to demonstrate how I used Sparktoro for data gathering.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>First search:</b> My audience “frequently talks about” Nike
          </p>
          <p>
            I also made sure to select the “United States of America” as the location for my audience. Because we’re launching in the US. I did this for all searches.
          </p>

    			<!-- End Featured Image -->
          <p>
            The result was 180,592 sources who frequently talk about Nike and are located in the United States of America. They all follow and amplify the list of social media accounts generated. Keep in mind, the SparkToro database has around 70 million profiles, so it doesn’t include every social media user on the planet yet. As the database grows, it is going to become more and more powerful as a research tool.
          </p>
          <p>
            The percent-of-audience column shows how many people in SparkToro’s database mention your search term on Twitter (in this case “Nike”) and follow that particular influencer. This was the high-value data I was looking for. The Sparkscore is also useful because it measures the reach of influencers based on reach relative to their following and compared to similar accounts.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
  					It’s worth remembering that the engagement rate is more important than reach alone.
  				</blockquote>
          <p>
            The tool provides a detailed breakdown of how it is calculated for each profile you highlight.

          <p>
            It’s worth remembering that the engagement rate is more important than reach alone. SparkToro also calculates an engagement score. Along with the SparkScore, this can be used to rank selected influencers.

    			<!-- End Featured Image -->
          <p>
            Because these scores are based only on data acquired from Twitter, I use other tools to audit influencers’ Instagram profiles.

    			<!-- End Featured Image -->
          <p>
            This fourth search was critical because people will most often use a brand’s social media handle when mentioning the brand in posts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I gathered the data, I cleaned it and performed an analysis (which I won’t detail in this post) for each brand I want to target. The results were magnificent. There were influencers who ranked high, and who you would expect to rank high because, for example, they are athletes sponsored by that brand. <b>But I also found influencers ranking even higher than some of these sponsored athletes, who I would have never thought to reach out to about Discount Deck&trade;.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The next step for me was to identify other brands that my audience was also interested in so that I could curate a secondary list of brands to target. I was able to quickly create lists of these adjacent brands. I used this data to create a graph of primary and secondary brands to target.
          </p>

    			<!-- End Featured Image -->
          <p>
            One thing I foresee being very beneficial on SparkToro is a column for sentiment analysis. I had to separately research whether the audiences were speaking positively or negatively when referring to Nike. A sentiment analysis column would make it easier to decide which influencers to work with and which other brands Nike’s audience is also interested in.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this data in hand, I was able to formulate a clear and concise methodology to solving the chicken-or-the-egg dilemma that my business was facing: Who comes first, the influencers or the brands?
          </p>
          <p>
            My pitch deck is stronger because of this information. Since the Coronavirus pandemic has made investments even more difficult to secure, I am grateful I hustled two years ago because I’m able to solve this problem <i>now</i>.
